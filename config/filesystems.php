         *   'url' is deliberately ABSENT. Defining it would make Storage::url() return

         *   (FR-6.3/FR-6.4). A public URL helper on this disk is a footgun with no
         *   legitimate caller.
         *
         *   'throw' => true, unlike the disks above. A silent false from put() during
         *   an upload would leave a 'pending' attachment row with no object behind it
         *   and no error to explain it — precisely the half-created record FR-6.8
         *   forbids. Failing loudly is what lets the service roll the row back.
         *
         *   region 'auto' is R2's own convention; the signature still requires one.
